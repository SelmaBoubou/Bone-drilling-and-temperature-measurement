# Bone-drilling-and-temperature-measurement
Internship project

# Introduction
This project was for my final year in Electrical and Industrial Data Processing. 
I did a 3 months internship in Malaysia  at the Universiti Teknologi Petronas.

My project was to measure the temperature during bone drilling for medical application.
And control which parameters influence the increasing of the bone temperature.

# Goals 
1. Literature review of papers, articles based on methods available
2. Preparation of the bone samples
3. Drilling of the bone samples
4. Collecting and Analyse the data
5. Give conclusion on the influences of each parameters during the experiments

# Equipements used
- Thermocouple
- Mazak Machine
- Roughness test SV-3000
- Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)

# Supervisor
Dr Turnad Lenggo Ginta

# Department
Mechanical Engineering
